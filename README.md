# synq-sqlmesh

synq-sqlmesh is a client application to integrate locally running SQLMesh to SYNQ

## How to use

If you have Golang installed, you can build the binary yourself, otherwise download appropriate binary from the [releases screen](https://github.com/getsynq/synq-sqlmesh/releases) (darwin == macOS).

`synq-sqlmesh` uses `web` module of `sqlmesh` to collect metadata. It was tested with versions `>= 0.96.x`. If you do not have `web` module installed do

```bash
pip install "sqlmesh[web]"
```

All commands assume `sqlmesh` command is available in the `PATH`. If that is not the case, `--sqlmesh-cmd` could be used to point synq-sqlmesh to proper location.

### Dump metadata for inspection

```bash
cd sqlmesh-project
synq-sqlmesh collect meta.json
```

### Automatic upload to SYNQ

Run the following code after you've executed `sqlmesh run`, `sqlmesh audit`, and `sqlmesh test`. For example, you can add it to your Airflow code if you use Airflow for orchestrating.

```bash
export SYNQ_TOKEN=<token>
synq-sqlmesh upload
```

The `token` value is obtained from the SYNQ UI when you click 'create' under SQLMesh integration

### Upload execution log

```bash

# run normal sqlmesh

sqlmesh audit | tee audit.log
synq-sqlmesh upload_audit audit.log

sqlmesh run | tee run.log
synq-sqlmesh upload_audit run.log

```

## Building from source code

Make sure at least golang 1.21 is installed and do:

```bash
go generate
go build -o synq-sqlmesh
./synq-sqlmesh version
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues using `synq-sqlmesh`, check the following common problems:

**1. `sqlmesh` or `sqlmesh[web]` not installed**

- Ensure you have installed SQLMesh with the web module:
  ```bash
  pip install "sqlmesh[web]"
  ```
- Make sure the `sqlmesh` command is available in your `PATH`, or use the `--sqlmesh-cmd` flag to specify its location.

**2. `SYNQ_TOKEN` not set or invalid**

- The `SYNQ_TOKEN` environment variable is required for uploading data to SYNQ.
- If you see an error like `SYNQ_TOKEN environment variable is not set`, obtain a token from the SYNQ UI and set it:
  ```bash
  export SYNQ_TOKEN=<your_token>
  ```

**3. SQLMesh UI fails to start or connect**

- The tool tries to start the SQLMesh UI by default. If it fails to connect, you may see errors like `SQLMesh did not start in time`.
- Check that you can run `sqlmesh ui` manually and access it at the configured host/port (default: `localhost:8080`).
- You can disable automatic UI startup with `--sqlmesh-ui-start=false` if you want to manage the process yourself.

**4. Network or API errors**

- If uploading fails, ensure you have network connectivity and the SYNQ API endpoint is reachable (`https://developer.synq.io/` by default).
- If you are behind a proxy or firewall, ensure it allows outbound connections to the SYNQ API.

**5. File content not collected as expected**

- By default, only certain file patterns are included. Use `--sqlmesh-collect-file-content` and adjust `--sqlmesh-collect-file-content-include`/`--sqlmesh-collect-file-content-exclude` as needed.
- If you see errors about file patterns, check your glob syntax.

**6. General errors**

- Most errors are printed to the console. If you see a message like `Failed to get meta information` or `Failed to upload execution log`, check the logs for more details.
- Run with increased verbosity (if supported) or check the logs for more context.

**7. Version compatibility**

- This tool was tested with SQLMesh versions `>= 0.96.x`. If you use a different version, compatibility is not guaranteed.
